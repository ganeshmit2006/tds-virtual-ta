<p>In the 6th question ,as I open the graded assignment all the time the new question is generated (NUMERICAL DATA) and the previous answer shows as incorrect answer</p>
<p>My doubt is that should I again and again answer the same quetion(6) all the time until the due passes?<br>
Is there any alternative ways to look after this problem?</p>
