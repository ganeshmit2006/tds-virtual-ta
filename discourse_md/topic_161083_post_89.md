<p>Hi Saravanan,</p>
<p>I noticed an issue with your submission. In the question, there is a name <code>Bob</code>, but it doesnâ€™t appear in your answer after applying the required sorting. Since the data for each student is dynamically generated and unique, the answer you submitted seems inconsistent with your dataset.</p>
<p>We encourage collaboration among students, but copying answers is not acceptable. Instead, I suggest reaching out to your friend to understand the script they used, run it on your dataset, and ensure you fully grasp the solution.</p>
<p>kind regards</p>
