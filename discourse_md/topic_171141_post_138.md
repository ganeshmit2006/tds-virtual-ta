<p><a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a>  Sir, the image id written in my notification email is wrong. The correct image is this: <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/24f1002064/project1/general" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/24f1002064/project1/general</a></p>
<p>can you please double check this? You can also verify that I have made no changes to it since the due date.</p>
