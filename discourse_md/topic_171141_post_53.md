<p>Yes, I agree.<br>
So, did my docker ID change when I submitted?<br>
I am sorry sir, but I did not make any changes after submitting the project, so I guess my Docker ID should remain the same as before, if I am not mistaken. I kindly request you to check just once more please, as I really donâ€™t know where I have went wrong.</p>
<p>Jivraj Sir had checked liked this for another student, so I just wanted to confirm the same for me.<br>
<em>" I looked for your response for project1 docker image, and found out that we used correct image id. Here is repo information <code>harshjaiswal1/tds_project_final      latest    d0f14a872042   5 weeks ago    214MB </code>"</em></p>
<p>Also sir, could you please tell me why the error as shown in my previous message is being shown? and if there is no chance of it getting correct.</p>
<p>thanks</p>
