<p>Can you please make the changes in the datagen.py file</p>
<p>config = {“root”: “/data”}</p>
<p>This is where I have been facing the issue.</p>
<p>The only solution I can think of is moving the /data folder from the root to the project directory. which I am not sure is a good way to solve this issue.</p>
