<p>Hi Guddu,</p>
<p>We are planning several project sessions in order to show the workflow of creating a successful project.</p>
<p>Although you are returning a 200 ok, the get request file must match the expectation. In other words after running the first task for example, has the new format.md been formatted correctly and matches the expected output.</p>
<p>In this case you would write out the the <code>expected</code> variable in the <code>evaluate.py</code> and see if <code>result</code> variable matches the <code>expected</code>. Then you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
