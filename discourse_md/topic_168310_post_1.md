Dear team,<br>
Greetings of the day</p>
<p>I am writing this to request for a functionality</p>
<ol>
<li>Practice the GAs again after their deadline has passed</li>
<li>Either the answers can be posted or the same question answering and simultaneous evaluation interface can work just like it does before the deadline.</li>
</ol>
<p>How this is beneficial?</p>
<ol>
<li>As the GATE exam has now been completed,  we can now practice the questions we either left or could not do at that time</li>
<li>Revision will help us ace the ROE, project and end term</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall this will increase the value of the already most practical and rewarding course of IIT BS i.e TDS.</p>
<p>Looking forward to your guidance and kind consideration<br>
Regards<br>
Aryan</p>
