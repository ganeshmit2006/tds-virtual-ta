<p><a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> good afternoon sir,<br>
I completed my project 1 and submitted it as instructed. But the result show that evaluate file missing. I did everything right but donâ€™t know how this as the result come. I also had evaluation file in my project too. Please go through things again as this is very unfair for those who took 2 weeks to do this project. My roll no. is 22f3001664. I hope I will get marks, of not full then should be 10/20.<br>
Thank you sir</p>
