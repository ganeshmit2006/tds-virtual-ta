My question 7 for GA6 is :<br>
A wildfire is threatening a rural mountain region, and emergency services need to coordinate evacuation routes for four remote communities. The Emergency Management Center is located at a central command post, and must plan the most efficient evacuation route to ensure rapid and safe community evacuation. The four communities are: Silver Springs Community : (42.1029,-85.665) ;Pleasant Harbor Community : (42.1238,-85.9043);Summit Shores Village : (42.0415,-85.8696);River Retreat Outpost : (42.0417,-85.6836) &amp; Central Command Post Location: (42.0587,-85.7226) Using the Haversine package, calculate the distance from the Central Command Post to Silver Springs Community. Which of the following is the MOST ACCURATE distance<br>
Whose options provided are :<br>
10418 meters</p>
<p>12287 meters</p>
<p>10965 meters</p>
<p>11149 meters</p>
<p>However, after trying all methods out there my distance comes out to be 6873 meters, I selected 10418 as the answer (closest approximation to 6873 meters)</p>
<p>I assume that the question must have been central command post to summit shores village (whose answer turns out to be 12287 meters)<br>
Kindly look into the question, and let me know about the same (the destination from central command post)</p>
