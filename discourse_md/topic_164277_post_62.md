<p>A query regarding the task description in the query given to LLM for phase A.</p>
<p>For task A3, we have been asked to count wednesdays and the python file corresponding to A3 does count for wednesday alone. However the example says the LLM might be asked to count Sundays or other days. Should we be modifying task A3 code? Or was that just an example and only Wednesdays would need to be counted?</p>
