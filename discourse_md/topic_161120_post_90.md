<p>I think you are running your application server inside a virtual machine because of which it doesnâ€™t have visibility to outside world(request coming from other domains). So you would need to identify  ipaddress of your virtual machine and would need to use that in place of <code>127.0.0.1</code>. Take help from GPT to identify ipaddress of virtual machine.</p>
