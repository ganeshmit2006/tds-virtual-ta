<p>Hi Shalini,</p>
<p>I deployed my code with your dataset and checked and checked answers for your dataset, so there is no errors in backend.</p>
<p>Since you are getting some output, it won’t help to look up to logs from vercel,  just check your code if it’s logically correct.</p>
<p>Kind regards<br>
