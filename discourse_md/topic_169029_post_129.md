<p>If there is any plan for extension, I request the TDS team to announce it in advance as people would rush and submit, then, they come hear about the extension when they had submitted it already.</p>
<p>Happened to me like almost every time. We have OPPE this weekend, so if there is slightest possibility, I request to announce it in advance.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
