This is a gentle reminder to kindly send the confirmation email indicating for whom the evaluation of Project 2 has been completed.</p>
<p>Additionally, I would like to confirm whether we can shut down our Azure VM after this, or if we should keep it running in case there is an additional evaluation. In one of the sessions, you had mentioned the possibility of offering alternate questions as a second chance for students, evaluated at half the original marking scheme (i.e., 2 marks per question).</p>
