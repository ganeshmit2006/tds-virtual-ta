<p>Hi instructors and TAs,<br>
For the different tasks in Phase B, I don’t have a clear idea of what type of a response you expect.</p>
<p>eg.</p>
<ul>
<li>Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database &amp; Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website &amp; Transcribe audio from an MP3 file - Do you want the query’s response on an output file like A10? or as a response?</li>
</ul>
<p>I understand that these are broad problems you except us to solve, but it would be helpful to know what type of response you would require.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
