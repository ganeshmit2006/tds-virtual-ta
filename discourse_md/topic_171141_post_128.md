<p>Hello sir</p>
<p>I noticed that the log mentioned:<br>
“python: can’t open file ‘/app/app/main.py’: [Errno 2] No such file or directory.”</p>
<p>However, my main file was named run.py, which might have caused the issue. Since the code was present, I was given a 0. Would it be possible to run it again or consider partial marks for the submission?</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and consideration. I appreciate your help!</p>
