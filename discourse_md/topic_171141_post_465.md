<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>We have sent the updated marks to Operations. At this time of the term they are very busy with lots of updates, so it will take time for them to push it to the dashboard. As soon as they inform us that the scores have been pushed, we will send out a discrepancy form if you find any issues with your score.</p>
<p>Thanks &amp; Kind regards</p>
