<p>Dear Instructors (<a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a>, <a class="mention" href="/u/iamprasna">@iamprasna</a>):</p>
<p>Confirming, just to be needfully pedantic:</p>
<p>It will <strong>solely</strong> be the responsibility of the Project Evaluator (human or machine) to parse the correct <code>AIPROXY_TOKEN</code> generated against my IITM email ID (presumably, per some database which holds all such generated <code>AIPROXY_TOKEN</code>s of the students who have generated one); and the correct <code>$IMAGE_NAME</code> (to-be-submitted by myself in the Project Submission Google Form) in <code>podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000</code>, correct?</p>
<p>Asking this seemingly obvious question, as (apparently) the actual <code>AIPROXY_TOKEN</code> is not to be included anywhere in the code, or the repository, or the dockerfile.</p>
