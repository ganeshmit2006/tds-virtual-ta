<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>In my course dashboard, Project 2 score is shown as zero. However, I had submitted the repository and API endpoints (<a href="http://35.192.157.22.80" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">http://35.192.157.22.80</a>) through the Google Form. I had received a mail to make edit in API end point if changed. I had edited my api end point by adding  /api/ and it was <a href="http://35.192.157.22/api/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">http://35.192.157.22/api/</a>. My server was running fine. I have worked hard to do this project and now receiving a score of zero. Kindly look into it.</p>
