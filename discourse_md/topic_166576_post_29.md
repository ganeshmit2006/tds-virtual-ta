<p>Respected <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a><br>
I am facing an issue with GA5 Q5, as my answer is being marked incorrect despite multiple attempts. I have processed data at OpenRefine .<br>
To ensure accuracy, I also tried a manual approach by converting the JSON file to Excel and filtering the data, but I arrived at the same answer each time. However, the assignment portal still shows it as incorrect.<br>
Sir Could you please check portal expected answer for this question.<br>
Thankyou</p>
