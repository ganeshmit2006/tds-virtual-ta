<p>The way we test your api is <strong>not through a front end.</strong></p>
<p>We send a request to the endpoint directly. We have demoed it in live sessions.</p>
<p>We have even posted on discourse snippets of what this looks like.</p>
<p>As long as your endpoint responds to a request that we send, it will be fine.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
