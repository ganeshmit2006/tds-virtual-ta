<p>The task B6 was<br>
<a href="https://quotes.toscrape.com/">https://quotes.toscrape.com/</a> has quotes from famous people.<br>
The .author class has the quote authorâ€™s name.<br>
Extract and save all authors from the first page, in order, to /data/b6.json as an array of strings.<br>
E.g. <code>["Douglas Adams", "J.K. Rowling", ...]</code></p>
<p>The output in your file is not an array of double quoted strings.</p>
<p>Instead it is an array of an json object with the keyword author and values as an array of authors.</p>
<p>These are two different things. Almost there but not quite.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
