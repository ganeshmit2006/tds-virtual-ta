“SATHUPALLE” and “NILANGA” were two of the four constituencies which were assigned to me. However, even with phonetic match, I couldn’t find any data for these.  Closest I could find to SATHUPALLE is “Sattenapalle”, however, two are different locations 150km+ apart as per google maps. Are these really in the dataset?</p>
