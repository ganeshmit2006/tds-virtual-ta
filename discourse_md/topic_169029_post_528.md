<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I recieved my Project 2 Scores and I have recieved 20/100. Two of us had shared the code and the other person has recieved higher marks. Whats the reason for this discrepancy? Kindly shed some light on this situation and please share any evaluation logs from your end. <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/saransh_saini">@Saransh_Saini</a></p>
