<p>there is a problem in question 7 and 8, fast api question, when i click on save, both api calls happens at once at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">http://127.0.0.1:8000</a>, and i can run fast api app for question 7 or 8 for one only, suppose i check for question 7 it shows correct, also for question 8 i check it shows correct , but when i try to save one of the answer gets incorrected because of simultaneous calls by question 7 and 8 at this address <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">http://127.0.0.1:8000</a></p>
