<p>very true there is too much confusion Id like to ask if you know that evaluate.py is mean to run only for <a href="mailto:user@example.com">user@example.com</a> or our own mail too  because there was written <strong>You MUST use your Student Id</strong> (eg. 22f3xxxxxx@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) <strong>to do the Project, otherwise your score will not be considered for evaluation.</strong></p>
