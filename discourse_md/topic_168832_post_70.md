<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/21f3002158">@21f3002158</a></p>
<p>I looked for your result in backend, seems like you didn’t click to submit button throughout the exam.</p>
<p>Since roe exam portal was similar to GA’s where you need to save answers using save button, after saving only your answers get evaluated and you get answers.</p>
<p>There is no way other than pressing save button, we can’t do any help with this.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
