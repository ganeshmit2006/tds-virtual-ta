# No Title

<p>In every TDS assignment after the first, I have not seen a submit button in the assignment page so I could not submit it there( I see it in the sanand portal and submit it there)</p>
<p>Now, my assignment score for all assignments (2,3,4,5) shows 0</p>
<p>I am attaching SS of my assignment-5 page to show there was no submit button available there</p>
<p>I had raised this as a ticket in the Support desk(21/Feb) in the past as discourse was not available to me at that time, but this didn’t get resolved. I saw a similar older thread where it was mentioned that this is not something to worry about but now it is showing in the portal that I am not allowed to take the End Term Exam. What can be done for this?<br>
