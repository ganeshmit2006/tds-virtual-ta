<p>When we saw that some students were taking the effort to do GA7, we decided that we would give them an opportunity as a reward for their diligence, to try and obtain some bonus marks. Are you jealous of their diligence?</p>

<p>Sir, this sounds reasonably fair. But, what about the students who were lethargic in probably week 1 or week 2, thinking that they can solve the GAs of later weeks? They also get benefitted from this.</p>
<p>I think the attitude of these students is the same as those who skipped GA&amp; as they got 100% GAA within the first five or six weeks</p>
