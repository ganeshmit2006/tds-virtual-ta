<p>Respected Sir,<br>
I made the similar mistake of not selecting a yes on the seek IITM portal<br>
According to your previous replies, does it imply that only the answers submitted through the link provided will be considered for evaluation regardless of the seek portal selection for this time?<br>
Thanks</p>
