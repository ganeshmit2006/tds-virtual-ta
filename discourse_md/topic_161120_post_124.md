<p>Hi Srividya,</p>
<p>Thats right the idea behind vercel is you do not need to create a server. Its serverless! Instead you create functions that respond to endpoints.<br>
When the endpoint is triggered, the appropriate function runs.</p>
<p>This renders <code>name == main</code> part of the code unnecessary at best, since python interpreters only run this line if that file was the starting point of the application (but its not, because a vercel wrapper application(s) or processes have started before it).</p>
<p>In other words you do not create a flask server, or a http server or indeed any server at all. Just functions tied to specific endpoints. So you have to rethink how your application is designed. You <em>do not</em> create serverless applications in the same traditional way you have been taught in MAD-1 or MAD-2.</p>
<p>This is a common mistake many students have been making with their approach to vercel. Watching the videos and using the provided code template will greatly help in deploying successful serverless applications.</p>
<p>Thanks for your input.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
