<p>The IMDB and weather questions was a pain along with the 10th question, wasted so much time <a class="mention" href="/u/s.anand">@s.anand</a> , the questions were nowhere tough, it was the problems with the evaluation part i had spend hours just to  sit and correct the JSON file and no comments on the 10th questionâ€™s part.</p>
<p>I am fine with the academia being challenging to study not the evalation making me manually edit solutions</p>
