<p>sir for my project 1 i got a mail stating that the docker file isn’t public and that’s why prerequisite failed. but i checked it and it seemed absolutely perfect to me. Please look into this issue as my docker repo is public and absolutely as per the requirement.  <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a></p>
