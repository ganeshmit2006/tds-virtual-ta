<p>Its unusual to have a docker container worth 7 GBs of space. Here is what you can do</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove unused libraries from your <code>requirements.txt</code>. Sometimes having resource demanding libraries like <code>SentenceTransformers</code> can install large sub-dependency packages.</li>
<li>Exclude your virtual environment folder from the container creation</li>
<li>Create a <code>.containerignore</code> file to have an exception for those folders you want to skip.</li>
<li>Clear your package cache and any vscode cache you might have.</li>
</ul>
