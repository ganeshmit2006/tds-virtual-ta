<p>I would request the TDS team to please consider making the evaluation criteria for project 2 a bit more liberal.<br>
5 random Questions with 4 marks each is quite harsh. I request you to make it more balanced like 2 Qs from each GA with 2 marks each or so. So that even if we canâ€™t exhaustively cover the whole number of questions, it gives mercy for the partial completion.</p>
<p>5 random question is a kind of lottery or luck based unless our app is perfect. Thanks</p>
