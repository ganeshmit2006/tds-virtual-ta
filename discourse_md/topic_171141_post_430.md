<p>Iâ€™ve got good news for you and 30 other students. Thanks to your diligent debugging effort that we were able to find this bug. For now the fix is that we will not evaluate you on a8 and catch the datagen exception so as to not cause cascading failures.</p>
<p>Thanks and kind regards.<br>
We will let you know the outcome of the evaluations soon.</p>
