<p>I didn’t submit the google form, I have made the github repo and docker image for TDS project 1. I, mistakenly, thought that I had submitted the google form but actually it was saved as a draft and closed my laptop. As soon as I realized my mistake, I hit the submit button but this was shown then,<br>
“The form TDS Jan 2025 - Project 1 Submission is no longer accepting responses.”</p>
<p>I apologize for this. I have been working on this project for weeks.<br>
This was my first TDS project. I would highly appreciated, if you could help me.<br>
Thankyou</p>
