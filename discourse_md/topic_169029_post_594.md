Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I’m sorry to bother you again, but I’m in a desperate situation and have no other option but to reach out through this channel.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in my previous message, my score has been marked as “absent,” even though I submitted my project well before the deadline. Additionally, I have not received any communication regarding a re-evaluation.</p>
<p>I kindly request you to look into this matter and provide a response at the earliest.</p>
