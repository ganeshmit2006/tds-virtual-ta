<p><a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a> I am making this post because I didn’t get reply to my <a href="https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/477">post on the same matter.</a></p>
<p>Please check it out. My app can remain deployed only till April 18th. In the Cloud Run logs, I do see some multiple POST requests made today with 200 response but I’m not sure whether it was the TDS team doing a re-evaluation or someone else.</p>
<p>Also, are there any updates on <a href="https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/451">this bug in project 1 in datagen.</a></p>
<p>Thanks.<br>
