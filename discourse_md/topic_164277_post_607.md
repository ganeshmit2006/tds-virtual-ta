<p>I would like to request some bonus like 0.5 bonus mark for each day of delay from the original expected date of receiving score for Project 1 (will be life-saving for us and will be an incentive for team to release scores quickly; or request to TAs if you had better ideas for helping us score more in Project 1)! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/smiley.png?v=14" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
