<p>Hi Team,</p>
<p>Yesterday, I received a mail stating that our <strong>Project 2</strong> would be <strong>reevaluated between 11 PM and 2 AM tonight</strong>, and that the following endpoint would be used to test the API:</p>
<p><img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/link.png?v=14" title=":link:" class="emoji" alt=":link:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> <a href="https://project2llm-production.up.railway.app/api/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://project2llm-production.up.railway.app/api/</a></p>
<p>However, I have not seen any logs in Railway during that timeframe, and my score on the dashboard is still showing as <strong>0</strong>.</p>
<p>Could you please confirm if my URL was actually reevaluated?</p>
<p>Thank you!<br>
