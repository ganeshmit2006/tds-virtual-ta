<p>There are a total of 57 questions in all 5 GAs(18+10+9+10+10).<br>
Due to so many different formats of accepting questions and solving them, my main question is:<br>
Is the main essence of this project related to deciphering cryptic js code in order to scrape it?</p>
<p>Some other doubts are</p>
<ol>
<li>Some questions ask for you to access some hidden divs in the html page and use that for solving (like week 1 q11)</li>
<li>Some questions ask you for AIPROXY TOKENs (like week 3 q9)</li>
<li>Some questions required manual correction to get correct answers (like week 4 q2)</li>
<li>Some questions require file output (like week 2 q2)</li>
</ol>
<p>How do we account for this? <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/s.anand">@s.anand</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a></p>
