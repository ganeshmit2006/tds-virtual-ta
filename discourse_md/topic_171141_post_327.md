<p>Hi, I work in the IT industry. There is no standard like “docker file has to be only in the root folder.”</p>
<p>If at all you are setting a requirement why was this not mentioned in the project page?</p>
<p>We were asked to build an app which solves the given tasks. You were OK for whatever code/tools/method to use as long as it works, there the “industry standard” didn’t show up ironically!!!</p>
<p>Only during evaluation, just because you had to build the image at your end because of some architectural issues, the “industry standard” comes in.</p>
<p>In the same industry that I work - we build the dockers and give it for prod push.</p>
