<p>Oh, good catch, <a class="mention" href="/u/23f2000237">@23f2000237</a> and <a class="mention" href="/u/siva.bhaskaran">@siva.bhaskaran</a> - I made a mistake in the evaluation script. It included the <code>span</code>.</p>
<p>I fixed it. Note: None of the earlier answers are affected, i.e. if you got it right earlier, itâ€™ll stay right.</p>
