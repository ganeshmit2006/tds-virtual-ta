<p><a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a> My P1 submission successfully passed all the basic sanity checks on February 15th and obtained a satisfactory score in the P1 evaluation, which was disclosed on March 29th. However, I received a communication today, April 1, stating that my Docker image is not present or public on DockerHub. I kindly request the TDS course team to investigate this matter at the earliest and provide a resolution for students encountering similar issues.</p>
<p>This situation is particularly dishearteningâ€”<strong>seeing days of effort and dedication to Project 1 reduced to nothing, especially given the already demanding pace of the course.</strong></p>
<p>I will appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
