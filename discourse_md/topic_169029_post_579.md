<p>I sincerely apologize for not using my official email address — it was an honest oversight and not an attempt to bypass any rules. I’d be truly grateful if you could kindly consider evaluating my project based on the  valid, timely submission and the active working links provided.</p>
<p>This situation is quite distressing for me, as it could result in a significant  setback, potentially requiring me to  repeat the entire course. I fully acknowledge that the mistake was mine — a small yet critical one — and I sincerely request that if there is even a slight possibility of evaluation, please consider it.</p>
<p>Please let me know if there is anything I can do to assist with verification. Your understanding and support would genuinely mean a lot.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>
