<p>When we build it after pulling it, it will get a unique identifier that makes sure we will only ever evaluate exactly that version. We pull it from your submission in the form.</p>
<p>In other words, if any changes occur to the docker repo, our id will no longer match a newer version of the file. This way we can make sure we are evaluating the right version every time. Your id does not have to match ours.</p>
<p>But we can detect changes made to the docker repo through our image id. I hope that is clear.</p>
<p>We will do some extra sanity checks before the 1/4/2025 just incase there are any issues. But thanks for asking the question.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
