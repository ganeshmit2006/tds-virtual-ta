<p><a class="mention" href="/u/iamprasna">@iamprasna</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> Please look into it once. According to point 3 of <a class="mention" href="/u/iamprasna">@iamprasna</a>â€™s post, I should get full credit for that question and it will take me to a perfect 100 score in ET from the current 97.
