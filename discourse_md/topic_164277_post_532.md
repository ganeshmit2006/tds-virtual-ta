<p>Hey I just got a mail saying that my github repo has no Dockerfile present. and im confused .</p>
<p>It doesnt mention anywhere that the dockerfile must be present in the root directory as a requirement/prerequisite of the project.</p>
<p>In my case its present inside the app directory. Could the team help clarify on this issue.</p>
