<p>The seek portal question is to confirm that the student has seen the GA. It does not actually give you a score. Otherwise students sometimes claim that they looked and did not find any GAs (this has happened in the past). Hence the two stage verification. You still need to <img src="https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/d/6/d67654c30e9fe72ff5970775fa393eaec8204779.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-01-13 at 12.50.02" data-base62-sha1="uBdHw4oedgj12GPapQyjBdVAGGl" width="53" height="35"> the submissions to get a score for the GA.</p>
<p>The actual GA questions are on <a href="https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/</a> via the seek portal or<br>
on the <a href="https://tds.s-anand.net/#/" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Tools in Data Science</a> introduction page.</p>
<p>Its just a more robust way of ensuring that students have indeed viewed the GAs.</p>
<p>As far your submission goes, we have your last submission and the score. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=12" title=":white_check_mark:" class="emoji" alt=":white_check_mark:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>We will check on our end why your submission has not reloaded into your browser.<br>
Normally these are stored in session storage. So if your browser has deleted them, it might have not loaded from our back end server. <a class="mention" href="/u/s.anand">@s.anand</a> will be able to confirm the reason for this problem.</p>
<p><strong>For the time being if you are making a fresh submission, just fill in all the answers in again, so that your latest submission will be marked correctly.</strong></p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
