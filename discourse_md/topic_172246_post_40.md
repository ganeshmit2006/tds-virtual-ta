<p>I wanted to follow up on my previous message regarding the 5 bonus marks for GA7 and further elaborate on the impact this may have on overall grades.</p>
<p>As outlined in the grading document, the best 4 out of 7 GA assignments carry a total of 15 marks. Since many students, including myself, scored well in our best 4 assignments, which were prioritized as we aimed to maximize our grades, we did not attempt GA7. The bonus marks for GA7 were announced after the deadline, which has led to a concern that this may create an imbalance in the overall grading.</p>
<p>For students who excelled in their top 4 assignments, the additional 5 marks from GA7 may not significantly alter their overall grade, as they have already demonstrated strong performance. Conversely, those who struggled initially and attempted GA7 in hopes of improving their grade may benefit more from this bonus. This could inadvertently disadvantage those of us who strategically focused on the highest scoring opportunities available to us.</p>
<p>Given that the bonus marks were introduced after grades were finalized, I respectfully ask if thereâ€™s a possibility to consider an adjustment in these</p>
