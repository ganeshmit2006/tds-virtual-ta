<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/saransh_saini">@Saransh_Saini</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> ,</p>
<p>In the sample curl command<br>
i.e.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">curl -X POST "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "question=Download and unzip file abcd.zip which has a single extract.csv file inside. What is the value in the "answer" column of the CSV file?" \
  -F "file=@abcd.zip"
</code></pre>
<p>It is given that only one file arguement is passed , can there be a usecase where multiple files are sent , for example GA-5 10th question Image reconstruction where there could be one file be the image another could be separate file with mapping, Although mapping can be given with question as well,<br>
But still can you please confirm if there will be only one file or there can be multiple files send to API?</p>
