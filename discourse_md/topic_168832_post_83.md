<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/jayeshbansal">@Jayeshbansal</a></p>
<p>Until not clicked on save button answers getâ€™s checked at frontend side only. There is no way we can validate it after deadline.</p>
<p>I trust you would have solved few questions and also would have checked before deadline but clicking on save button was must to get submission evaluated.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
