Hi Sir,<br>
I hope you’re doing well. I just wanted to let you know that I put a lot of effort into completing <strong>Project1</strong>, but I accidentally named the <strong>Dockerfile</strong> as <code>dockerfile</code> (with a lowercase ‘d’).<br>
Could you please consider evaluating it with that name? I’d really appreciate it.<br>
Thank you!<br>

    Subject: Request for Verification of Dockerfile and Reevaluation of Marks for Project 1 
<a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a> 
Sir, 
Regarding the recent feedback on Project 1 for TDS, it was mentioned that there is no Dockerfile in my GitHub repo. However, the Dockerfile is named dockerfile (not Dockerfile). Please verify the repository again with this in mind. 
Additionally, my Docker image architecture is linux/amd64 (64-bit x86). I have also filled out the Architecture Information Collector form as requested.
