<p>My marks are also showing as zero.</p>
<p>My suggestion is to provide students with the logs of your evaluation script, so we know if it is that server was not reachable, the answer is incorrect, or the response format was incorrect..etc</p>
<p>Request you to let us know if there is going to be re-evaluation so we can get the Azure instance running again</p>
