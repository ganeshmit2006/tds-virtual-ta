<p>For those who want to experiment with GPT-4o Mini (or other models), <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/models">Github Models</a> is free. You can explore and compare models, including GPT-4o Mini, DeepSeek R1, and others.</p>
<p>It has rate limits, so you canâ€™t use it in production, but is a good place to prototype applications and experiment with prompts.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you face any problems accessing it.</p>
