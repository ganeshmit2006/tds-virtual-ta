<p>All the image ids we evaluated were what <em>you</em> submitted to us. This is the list of docker repos that was given to us by <a class="mention" href="/u/s.anand">@s.anand</a> as the official list that met all the pre-requisites of Project 1. Therefore we will only evaluate those on this list who are eligible for evaluation with the repos <em>you</em> gave us.</p>
<p>For clarity. Your docker repo gets a unique id every time it is changed. We will ONLY evaluate the image id which was present at the time of the docker repo being pulled. This acts as a time stamped frozen version of your repo. No other image id will be evaluated.</p>

<p>If you find bugs in our evaluation scripts, you might benefit from more marks because of the bug fix. So it is in your interest to look through our scripts and logs and identify bugs or anomalies. You might just go from 0 to heros.</p>
