<p>I would like to sincerely thank the course faculty <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/saransh_saini">@Saransh_Saini</a> for their support on the project throughout the week. They were so patient in listening to our issues and helping us resolve them, even if the issues were repeated.</p>
<p>I was not able to complete some or maybe many of the tasks but overall, it was a very good learning for me, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.</p>
<p>Thanks very much again for your guidance and support.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
