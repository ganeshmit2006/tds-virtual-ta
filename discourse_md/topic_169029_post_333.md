<p>Dear Sir <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a>,</p>
<p>Sir, please note that after the deadline I haven’t resubmitted the form but I have edited it (as the form was allowing editing till then). Now what exactly have I edited is just added a “/” at the end and that’s it and nothing more. Highlighting it again, I haven’t resubmitted the form but edited it on the very next morning after the deadline.</p>
<p>So now my question is: My edited response will be accepted right in this case?<br>
Sir, please throw some light on my doubt.</p>
<p>Warm Regards,<br>
