Respected Sir,<br>
Sir I made a mistake while submitting the GFORM in hurry, I submitted the deployment URL instead of API URL:<br>
currently for re-evaluation my URL that I received on my mail id is:</p>
<p><code>https://tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app/</code></p>
<p>but for API testing we need to add /api/ to the URL so final URL is:</p>
<p><code>https://tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app/api/</code></p>
<p>Iâ€™m sorry for this mistake sir, please accept this small change, we just need to add /api/ to the URL</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>actually 2 of my friend had submitted similar url with no /api/ but he got 80 marks and I also submitted without /api/ url but I got 0 so for re evaluation sir please add /api/ to the original URL as mentioned Above Please Sir</p>
<p>Thank you<br>
