# No Title

<p>There are no evaluation logs for you, I am not sure which evaluation log you are referring to. Your docker image fails to run the required task because your Dockerfile is misconfigured. Did you follow the test environment setup mentioned in this post before posting your query?</p>

    To replicate the test environment: 
Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that 
import requests
import pandas 
DEADLINE = pd.Timestamp("2025-02-18", tz="Asia/Kolkata")

url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits"
try : 
    response = requests.get(url,headers=github_headers, timeout=60)
    fetch_commit = None
    if response.status_code == 200:
        commits = response.json()
        for commit in commits:
            sha = commit["sha"]
   …

<p>Because if you did, you will realise why your evaluation failed.<br>
You must replicate the test environment and then if you submission works, you have a legitimate appeal. Otherwise we will not consider it. Please replicate the issue using the test environment as detailed in the post link.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>

![Here are a few options for alt text, depending on the context and purpose:

**Short and descriptive:**

*   Man with glasses smiling.

**More specific (if relevant):**

*   Portrait of a man wearing glasses and a purple shirt.
*   Headshot of a man with short dark hair and square-rimmed glasses.

**If the person is important or known:**

*   [Name of Person] smiling.

I recommend choosing the alt text that best suits the context and information you want to convey.](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/carlton/48/56317_2.png)
