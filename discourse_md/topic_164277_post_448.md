<p><a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> needed a confirmation on this task</p>
<p><code>A8 * `/data/credit-card.png` contains a credit card number. Pass the image to an LLM, have it extract the card number, and write it without spaces to `/data/credit-card.txt</code> - in this task i assume prompt can ask for credit card number or other details like cvv and name.</p>
<p>My question is, whether my system should allow prompt that CVV or or such info ? or should give it ?</p>
