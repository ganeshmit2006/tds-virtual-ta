<p>If you are using the function calling approach, you could just parse the ‘#’ and change it to ‘number’ and then send the prompt to the llm for that particular task.</p>
<p>Or another approach is tell the llm,</p>
<p>If you ever see the phrase ‘count the # of’ in a task, please interpret it as ‘count the number of’. For example<br>
Count the # of Fridays means<br>
Count the number of Fridays</p>
