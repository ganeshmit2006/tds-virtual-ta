<p>Respected Sir,</p>
<p>I hope you’re all doing well. I’m writing regarding my Project 1 evaluation, as I’ve encountered a discrepancy that I’d like some help with.</p>
<p>According to the evaluation email I received, my score was 0 for all the tasks with an additional bonus of 1 (totaling a P1 score of 1). However, when I ran the provided evaluation script before my submission, I got 7 in Phase A. Additionally, after reviewing the Docker logs, evaluation logs, and the p1_evaluation_error_logs (from the linked Google Sheets), I couldn’t find any reference to my roll number.</p>
<p>Could someone please help me investigate this issue? I’d really appreciate any guidance from the evaluation team.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and assistance!</p>
