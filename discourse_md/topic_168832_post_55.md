<p>Hello Sir"s, <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/saransh_saini">@Saransh_Saini</a></p>
<p>I was able to successfully attempt only 5 questions within the time limit. But due to internet issues, I could not submit exactly at 1:45pm.<br>
My last submission was at 1:47pm. But if there was a auto save then you could already check my answers were in the portal.</p>
<p>I request you to please consider submission delays of 2-3 mins as this was due a technical glitches. And we too are switching tabs and running in vscode<br>
