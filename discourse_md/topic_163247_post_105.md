<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I’m sorry if I’m asking an unrelated question, But I’m very confused with the concept of generating the token from <a href="https://platform.openai.com/api-keys" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://platform.openai.com/api-keys</a></p>
<p>Could any one suggest the step by step process? I couldn’t able to find that similar question asked by anyone since the conversations are vast.</p>
<p>Please guide me on this. Also do i need to use my personal mail id or iitm mail id for accessing this token</p>
