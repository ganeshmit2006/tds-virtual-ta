<p>Hi Aindree,</p>
<p>No its a typo (and will be corrected soon). In the context of what was written it clearly means it was <em>updated</em> on 27th January. The update being that the evaluation.py file was provided so that you could test your code against it.</p>
<p>Thanks for bringing it to our attention.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
