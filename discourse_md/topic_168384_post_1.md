<p>Hello Sir,</p>
<p>I understand from the email we received that there are three mock ROEs scheduled. I wanted to check if it is mandatory to attempt the mock at 7 PM or if there is flexibility in the timing. As a working professional, I may not be able to attempt the mock at 7 PM.</p>
<p>Could you please confirm if there is any flexibility in the timings? Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could provide details on when and how the mock links will be shared.</p>
<p>Thanks and Regards<br>
Shalini</p>
