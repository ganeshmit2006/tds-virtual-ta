<p>Hi Abhay,</p>
<p>This was a basic error. Unfortunately for basic errors we are not able to relax the requirements. All students were given a clear directive on what the minimum requirements were in order to be evaluated. Failure to follow those clear instructions prevents us from making any exceptions, because then we just have to dump all those requirements for all students and that would not be fair to those that took the care to be careful about their submissions.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
