<blockquote>
<p>In Graded Assignment - 4 &gt;&gt; Q2, the year I extracted appears as “2024,” whereas the expected value on the portal is “2024–”. I have manually adjusted several values based on the expected format. This issue is specific to the year field.</p>

<p>I guess for the year part, there are certain series having multiple seasons, for which hyphenated “years” are given.</p>
<p>For the particular instance - <code>“2024–”</code>, it appears another season/part is announced, thats why it is written that way.</p>
