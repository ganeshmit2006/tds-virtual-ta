<p>Firstly, you have passed evaluation and got a decent score (on a more lenient script that we used for everyone.) The email was sent by a script that used a more stricter evaluation (which understandably caused some stress). So you can breathe a sigh of relief. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/slight_smile.png?v=14" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p><em>However</em> with regards to your long postâ€¦</p>
<p>Let me tell you a true story. I personally know a <em>very</em> experienced senior engineer at a top defense contractor for the US, here is some pearls of wisdom from him.</p>
<p>What you have done is what is called in industry as <strong>gold plating</strong>. Its a cardinal sin in software engineering. NEVER gold plate. ALWAYS build to spec.</p>
<p>In fact its a good reason to fire an engineer. Why?</p>
<ol>
<li>Because it does not deliver what was required,</li>
<li>Wastes valuable time and resources</li>
<li>Increases technical debt (this is actually a huge cost over the expected lifetime of the project!)</li>
<li>Complicates testing</li>
<li>Leads to scope creep</li>
</ol>
<p>His advice to me was simple: NEVER gold plate.</p>
<p>I hope you take this pearl of wisdom in your career. It will help you advance and make you stand out.</p>
<p>For personal hobbies this does not apply. But for a client (including us) if you fail to deliver the minimum spec then we cannot grant you an evaluation (by the way this post is not targetted specifically for you, it just felt like an appropriate place to explain this).</p>
<p>Kindest regards</p>
