<a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> sorry to disturb you, project1 deadline is over.<br>
I made a mistake in my project. In my call llm function i set some payload instead of default for open ai api call like max token, temp. , n, stop etc.<br>
Due to this, some tasks may fail especially credit card image task will fail 100%, if possible can i just remove that payload from git hub repository . or you can check this call llm function present in my task_handler.py file of my repository.<br>
I found this issue after deadline. If possible consider this request. I never engaged in a project or course like for this one. I love this project genuinely.</p>

Thankyou<br>
