<p>This project is one of the best experiences I had in the entire degree program. I could say this without any hesitation that what I learnt in the past 10 days &gt;&gt; last 3 months.</p>
<p>I really appreciate the idea of open internet type of evaluations, wherein, you implement things without any constraints, learning for the sake of implementing.</p>
<p>Doing this project, I also found many new ideas wherein function calling can be used to solve new problems. I also learned many new things from enthusiastic peers like <a class="mention" href="/u/23f1002382">@23f1002382</a> and also got the chance to help a few.</p>
<p>I thank the entire TDS team - <a class="mention" href="/u/s.anand">@s.anand</a> sir, <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> , <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a> for their support throughout this amazing experience.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
