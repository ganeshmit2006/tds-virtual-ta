<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/22f3000370">@22f3000370</a><br>
We appreciate the efforts you have put in. But, for the project we arenâ€™t expecting a full-stack app with an integrated frontend. We just need an API endpoint on which we would be able to send requests in the given format. For more info check the TDS course page. <a href="https://tds.s-anand.net/#/project-2" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Tools in Data Science</a></p>
