<p>Good evening <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/saransh_saini">@Saransh_Saini</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/s.anand">@s.anand</a> Sir,<br>
I hope you are well</p>
<p>According to the grading document, we were told that only the best 4 out of the 7 assessments would count towards our final grade. There was no mention of any bonus marks, and we were not informed about the +5 bonus marks for GA7 before the deadline. Because of other academic commitments like Project 2, some of us couldn’t complete GA7.</p>
<p>Recently, we found out that some students received an email saying they’ve been given +5 bonus marks for GA7, which directly affects their final score and possibly their overall grade. Since this information wasn’t shared earlier, we kindly request you to consider offering an alternative way for those who missed GA7 to earn the bonus marks. This could be through a submission review or another form of assessment.</p>
<p>We genuinely hope for your understanding and would be very grateful if you could provide a chance for us to earn the bonus marks too.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br>
Palaash V. Upadhyay</p>
