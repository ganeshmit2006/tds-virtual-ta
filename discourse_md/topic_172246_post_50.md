<p>I am frankly surprised by this outcome. I donâ€™t see how there could have been large variances in scores different evaluators would have given to a student.</p>
<p>I hope the data is not being skewed because of the  total number of evaluations being low, or because of differing perceptions about how a student needs to be scored, or any other reason.</p>
