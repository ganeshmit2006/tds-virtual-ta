<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a>,<br>
My Project 1 scores are not visible on the part, I have definitely submitted before the deadline and on the grades section - its coming as not submitted. I have mailed support team as well. Will it be possible to check the same in any manner.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
