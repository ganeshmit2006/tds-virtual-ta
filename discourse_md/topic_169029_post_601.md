<p>These are my new endpoints:       <a href="https://gasolver-hgayefe7b0avhpc6.southindia-01.azurewebsites.net/api/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://gasolver-hgayefe7b0avhpc6.southindia-01.azurewebsites.net/api/</a>           I have replied to the email regarding the re-evaluation message that was sent to me. Since I deleted the Azure Web Service Plan after receiving instructions from the TDS team to stop the service, I now need to host it again .Please let me know the next steps.</p>
