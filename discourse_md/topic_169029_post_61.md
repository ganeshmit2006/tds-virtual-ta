<p>I am not sure how you came to that conclusion!</p>
<p>For example vercel question still requires a vercel endpoint that will respond.</p>
<p>What I said is some questions might not need you to use those specific tools. Your answers should still be legitimate answers that one can paste into the text box of a GA and still get it correct.</p>
<p>The only question that will not be asked is the LLM say yes question.</p>
<p>A github account would still need you to commit a file to it and provide the url that is reachable.</p>
<p>etc.</p>
