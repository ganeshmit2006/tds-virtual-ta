<p>the model keeps wrong answer, it says uvicorn for uv and has no info on how to run uv even after explicitly giving instructions(basically an older model) , basic “ls” command is also wrong, among other things. You can check your logs with respect to my api key.<br>
Do you think we could access a better model?</p>
<p>Maybe Download Deepseek 70b or even 671b and create an api while y’all run the model locally, in the long it would be cheaper for the course?<br>
because the model doesn’t know basic commands after telling how to do it.<br>
So if the model gives us wrong commands 2/3 times then how would we even solve the question.<br>
I spent a week on this just saying<br>
