<p>Dear Sirs,</p>
<p>I apologize for the inconvenience caused by reaching out again. I came to know that many students have received an email stating that the re-evaluation for Project 2 will be conducted today between 11 PM and 2 AM. However, I have not received any such communication on my end.</p>
<p>I would like to bring to your attention that I actively helped several peers deploy their servers on Vercel and resolve various issues, and many of them received marks as high as 80. Unfortunately, my own record still shows as “Absent,” despite the fact that I submitted the Google Form well before the deadline and my server has been live and running for over two weeks.</p>
<p>For your verification, I am attaching screenshots of my GitHub repository and the Vercel deployment dashboard, which clearly show the deployment.</p>
<p>I sincerely request you to kindly consider this issue. This situation has caused significant mental stress, especially as I had already faced a grading issue in Project 1. The anxiety and uncertainty around my Project 2 score have negatively affected my focus during the end-term exam and viva for other projects as well. Receiving a zero in this project would only further impact my overall performance and morale, despite the genuine effort I have put in.</p>
<p>I genuinely hope for a positive response and a fair re-evaluation.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your time and understanding.</p>
