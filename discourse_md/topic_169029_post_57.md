<p>Like instead of <code>code -s</code> there won’t be any other command, otherwise it would require installation of VS Code inside a container to find the answer or this type of questions won’t be part of evaluation at all?</p>

<p>there will not be any other command. This question can be solved with a hardcoded answer</p>
<p>Excel and Google sheet questions can be solved by just using python . No excel or google sheets required.</p>
<p>The question WILL be parameterised however. So the numbers might be different. You should just understand what the question is asking and solve it programatically to get the answer.</p>
