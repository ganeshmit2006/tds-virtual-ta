<p>Good Morning Sir,<br>
Sir even I am facing a similar issue, even though sanity check for docker image on docker hub was cleared but got a mail saying ‘dockerfile’ not present in the GitHub repo while it clearly was. Sir please look into it we have given so many days to complete this project.</p>
<p>Looking forward to your reply.</p>
<p>Thank you<br>
