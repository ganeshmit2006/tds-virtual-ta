<p>Thank you, sir, for giving us this amazing opportunity! Honestly, I learned more in the last week than I did throughout the three modules.</p>
<p>The project was a rollercoaster ride—especially with all the errors that kept popping up—but overall, the experience was incredibly enriching. The amount of knowledge I gained was truly valuable.</p>
<p>A huge thanks to <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@Carlton</a>, <a class="mention" href="/u/saransh_saini">@Saransh_Saini</a>, and <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a> sir for their guidance and support. Without the last week’s lectures, the project couldn’t have been completed.</p>
