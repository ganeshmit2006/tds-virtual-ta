I would like to bring to your attention that the project URL I submitted was accessible and working correctly in my browser, even without the “http” or “https” prefix. A friend of mine submitted a similar URL and received full marks. Furthermore, I have updated my URL using HTTPS via Google Forms, so I kindly request you to consider evaluating my project using the latest URL provided.</p>
<p>This is a humble request, as I am currently at risk of receiving a grade ‘E’, which will significantly impact my overall CGPA. As an alternative, I am also willing to retake the course in the next term and pay the fee again if needed.</p>
<p>In the P1, unfortunately scored zero due to a minor mistake and was not given an opportunity to correct it. I truly believe that in real-life scenarios, we are often given chances to rectify such errors, and I sincerely hope for the same consideration here.</p>
