<p>hey I have a few doubts, if something was said about this please say so.</p>
<ol>
<li>in Phase be tasks do we have to store the output in files or just return it in the response</li>
<li>When I call my some of my endpoints using post man or CURL they work but if I run the evaluate.py it throws an error, this I think is a bug in the eval.py file.</li>
</ol>
<p>any idea about these ?</p>
