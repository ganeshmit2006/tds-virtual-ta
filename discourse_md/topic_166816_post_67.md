<p>I have checked the backend server. The actual score is 85 in Module 1.</p>
<p>Ignore seek portal, because scores are evaluated externally on our server. Those scores on seek portal are just from the placeholder question that asked whether you saw GA1 and attempted it. It has no bearing on your actual marks.</p>
<p>The actual score will be in the dashboard soon.</p>
<p>Kind regards.</p>
