<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Clarification Regarding Project 2 Reevaluation</p>
<p>Hi Team,</p>
<p>I received an email yesterday stating that our Project 2 would be reevaluated between 11 PM and 2 AM tonight.<br>
However, I havenâ€™t seen any deployment logs on Railway during that timeframe, and my score on the dashboard is still showing as 0.</p>
<p>My url is working perfectly still there is no logs in the railway.</p>
<p>Could you please confirm whether my Project 2 was actually reevaluated?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
