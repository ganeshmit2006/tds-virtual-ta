<p>Issue resolved for me after following below step<br>
After creating the workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trigger the workflow and wait for it to complete</li>
<li>Ensure it appears as the <strong>most recent action</strong> in your repository</li>
<li>Verify that it creates a commit during or within 5 minutes of the workflow run</li>
</ul>
