<p>The answer choices for questions 1 and 2 in graded assignment 6 are quite confusing. Both questions are single-select, yet three out of the four options are correct in each case. Iâ€™m unsure whether to choose one of the correct options or if the question is actually asking for the incorrect one. Could someone please clarify?</p>
