<p>Sir, I had submitted the project on 31st March at 11:30 PM itself. However, I made a change to the Vercel endpoint and updated it on 1st April. I can provide a screenshot of the Vercel deployment as proof. Unfortunately, I didn’t keep a copy of the Google Form submission. But to be honest, I shared the deployed project with some of my friends on 1st and 2nd April, after my edit, and they submitted it through the form after me. They received marks, but I haven’t received the same.</p>
