<p>Alright, <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@Carlton</a>. No problem at all, and thank you for your response.</p>
<p>I just wanted to bring a small limitation in my project’s LLM function to your attention, which I discovered after submission. It may impact one or two tasks. However, no concerns—this has been a great learning experience.</p>
<p>And if possible, just add one line in your Evaluation LLM prompt: <em>“Give loose marking for effort!”</em>—because, you know, creativity deserves some extra credit! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=12" title=":slightly_smiling_face:" class="emoji" alt=":slightly_smiling_face:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
