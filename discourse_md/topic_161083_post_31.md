<p>Hi Shouvik,</p>
<p>Your code seems correct to me. I think there is an extra space before your answer in input box.</p>
<p>Btw instead of using a while loop, there is a much more optimal, which uses difference of dates and doesnâ€™t require a loop at all. Try to figure it out.</p>
<p>kind regards</p>
