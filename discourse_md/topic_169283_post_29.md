<p>for question 4, i have tried <code>=forecast</code> and also <code>=forecast.ets</code>, both of them are not working. There are two columns for years. One is year of manufacturing, another is year of registration. which one to take.</p>
<p>for question 7, none of the options match. I am selecting the <code>MOST ACCURATE</code> among the given options. Hope, it is correct</p>
