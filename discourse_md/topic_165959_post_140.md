<p>Sir, In Graded Assignment - 4 &gt;&gt; Q2, the year I extracted appears as “2024,” whereas the expected value on the portal is “2024–”. I have manually adjusted several values based on the expected format. This issue is specific to the year field.</p>
<p>I use different classes to extract values for various fields. Could there be any other element on the portal affecting this extraction?</p>
<p>In Q4, one of my classmates is encountering a “root property” error despite using the same extraction method as I do. Upon checking, I found that this issue occurs because the city’s time is displayed as the previous day compared to our time. The portal results seem to be based on the city’s actual time rather than IST.<br>
I would appreciate your guidance on these issues.</p>
