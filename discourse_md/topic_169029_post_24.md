<p>I have few questions just going through the Project 2 problem statement.</p>
<ol>
<li>Are we supposed to use OpenAI api’s or locally/private hosted one?</li>
<li>Many of the questions need files or images or audio files as input, same api is expected to handle those also?</li>
<li>Can we work in a team and submit the project together?</li>
<li>If we are to use locally hosted llm system, our systems are not strong enough to run most of the good ones locally</li>
<li>Is it possible to get a TA to collaborate in our project as an observer?</li>
</ol>
<p>awaiting a response.</p>
<p>Thank you…</p>
