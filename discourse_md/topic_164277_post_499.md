# No Title

<p>I had a question on evaluation by the course team. To test that my application would run everywhere, I first deleted all images from my local machine using <code>podman rmi -a</code> and then ran <code>podman run --rm -p 8000:8000 -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN $IMAGE_NAME</code> with the appropriate variables set. This is as per the instructions provided <a href="https://github.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tree/tds-2025-01-project-1-wip/project-1" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">here</a>. But this gave me the following error:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Error: short-name "freshbash/dataworks-agent" did not resolve to an alias and no unqualified-search registries are defined in "/etc/containers/registries.conf
</code></pre>
<p>The above is the format in which we have to provide the image name in the Google form. So, I was confused whether this would succeed during actual evaluation.</p>
<p>The only way its working right now is when I specify the image name to be <code>docker.io/freshbash/dataworks-agent</code></p>
<p>Iâ€™m not yet very good with how containers work so some insights would be very helpful. Thanks!</p>
