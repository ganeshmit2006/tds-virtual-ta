# No Title

[Original Post](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/164277/284)

<p>For as task description like this</p>
<ul>
<li>Write the # of Thursdays in <code>/data/extracts.txt</code> into <code>/data/extracts-count.txt</code></li>
</ul>
<p>I have given the prompt in such detail to the LLM but it is still not able to understand the task because of the “#” symbol. The task is getting truncated even before it reaches to the LLM.<br>
Can anyone help me on this because I have tried so many things to fix this but nothing seems to help.</p>
