<p>You will get an email at 7pm with the ROE dataset and the question form.<br>
I will also add the same in the student seek portal.<br>
Mock ROEs are not proctored (its a mock!) and the actual ROE is not proctored either!<br>
The gmeet is after the mock ROE where it will be solved live by the TDS team.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
