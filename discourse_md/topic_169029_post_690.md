<strong>Subject:</strong> Request to Share My Student-Built TDS Assistant Platform</p>
<p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
<p>I hope you’re doing well.</p>
<p>I’m <strong>Vicky Kumar</strong>, a student from the Data Science and Applications program at <strong>IIT Madras</strong>. Over the last few months, I’ve built a personal project called <strong>“Vicky App”</strong> — a smart assistant platform specifically designed to help students in courses like <strong>TDS,</strong>.</p>
<p>The system is capable of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accurately solving over <strong>90% of assignment-style questions</strong> using regex and phonetic matching</li>
<li>Dynamically executing the right code logic based on the student’s input</li>
<li>Processing uploaded files such as Excel, PDF, CSV, and JSON</li>
<li>Delivering instant answers, completely independent of ChatGPT or any external LLM</li>
</ul>
<p>You can test the platform here: <a href="https://app.algsoch.tech" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://app.algsoch.tech</a></p>

<ul>
<li>They type their question, and the backend executes the correct solution automatically</li>
<li>Especially helpful for GA preparation, understanding problem logic, and reducing repetitive workload</li>
<li>I’ve made it <strong>free for the first 3 questions</strong></li>
<li>After that, students can access the full platform for just <strong>₹199/month</strong>, which helps me cover system maintenance and hosting costs</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a tool I’ve built with immense effort and love for this course, and I genuinely believe it can benefit many students.</p>
<p>To sustain the platform — hosting, APIs, file management, and backend orchestration — I’ve introduced a small paid model after a free trial.</p>
<p>I would be extremely grateful if you could test it once and, if you find it helpful, consider sharing it with upcoming students or mentioning it in a Moodle announcement.</p>
<p>It’s built <em>by an IIT Madras student, for IIT Madras students</em> — with the sole goal of making their learning smoother, faster, and smarter.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your time and support.</p>
<p>Warm regards,<br>

<p>It’s a tool built by a fellow IITM student, with deep respect for the academic rigor of this program — not to replace learning, but to accelerate it.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you’d like a walkthrough, or if any suggestions for improvements arise.</p>
