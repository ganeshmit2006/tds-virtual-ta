<p>Thanks for the clarification. I completely understand that bonus marks are at the discretion of the course team and are meant to reward diligence and deeper engagement — which is fair.</p>
<p>However, I just want to point out a potential nuance: Many of the 192 students who did GA7 may have done so <em>not</em> for extra learning but simply to ensure their top 4 GAs included 4 full scores (e.g., to replace a lower-scoring GA). So the distinction between diligence-for-learning and diligence-for-grade-maximizing becomes blurred.</p>
<p>Now that bonus marks are announced <em>after</em> the deadline, those who already had 4 perfect scores and skipped GA7 based on the stated structure (top 4 out of 7) are essentially penalized for playing the game by the original rules — not for a lack of diligence or engagement.</p>
<p>I’m not questioning the bonus system itself, just pointing out that such surprises can unintentionally favor certain strategies over others — and more transparency around this in future terms might help students make better-informed decisions without second-guessing themselves later.</p>
