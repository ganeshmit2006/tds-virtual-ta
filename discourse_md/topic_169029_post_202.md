<p>I am going to clarify this once and for all<br>
The response should be a <strong>JSON Object</strong> with the value of the <code>"answer"</code> key as a string.</p>
<pre data-code-wrap="python"><code class="lang-python">{ "answer" : "YOUR_ANSWER_AS_STRING" }
</code></pre>
<p>This is the way we are expecting your responses.<br>
However, due to the heavy confusion among students and will be considering responses with entire JSON objects stringified. We donâ€™t want anyone to loose their marks for such a miniscule error.<br>
So,</p>
<pre data-code-wrap="python"><code class="lang-python">"{\"answer\": \"YOUR_ANSWER\"}"
</code></pre>
<p>is also valid.</p>
