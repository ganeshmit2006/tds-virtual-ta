<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I know that some of you might be feeling anxious about your scores etc. We are currently in the process of validating your scores on all the projects, roe, assignments, exam and bonus, so we will not be able to respond quickly to each individual post here for the time being.</p>
<p>Once we validate, you will receive an email with your official scores that we will be pushing to Operations in a single update. Along with that email you will receive a discrepancy form where you can raise your issues. This will give us a consolidated view of problems and fix them.</p>
<p>Kindly wait for the email to come to you. It will be sent sometime this afternoon.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>TDS Team</p>
