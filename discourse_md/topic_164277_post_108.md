<p>I’m getting an error in task a2, def do_a2():<br>
“”“Format markdown using prettier”“”<br>
format_md_path = DATA_ROOT / “format.md”<br>
subprocess.Popen([“prettier”, str(format_md_path), “–write”, “–parser”, “markdown”])<br>
print(“data formatted successfully”)</p>
<p>any idea how to fix this? Also in A8, a 5 and a 3 is getting interchanged. Can someone help why that is hapening, I changed the prompt to include caution about not switching 3 and 5 as well, that didn’t help either</p>
