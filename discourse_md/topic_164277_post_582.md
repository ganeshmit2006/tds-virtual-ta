EDIT: Create a new docker image with the mistaken image name , so when they pull image from repo, that image with the wrong name also gets pulled.<br>
what to do</p>
<ul>
<li>push a new image with the mistaken name, so in your repo there will be two images<br><br>
how will this help?</li>
<li>since you are unsure, which image link you posted, you can be sure that even you had a mistake in link, a new image will exist with the wrong name after you push another image</li>
</ul>

use this to update your image even after submission, as now they only validate the images, they do not pull it so you can edit your project and add more functionality if they release the code solutiion</p>
