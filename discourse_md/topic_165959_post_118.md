<ol>
<li>There are only four texts which look like link texts in the pdf.<br>
All four properly coded in link markdown syntax, in the preview, they appear as  link texts same as in pdf.</li>
</ol>
<p><a>Link text</a></p>
<p>Even after chaning all the 4 texts which appered in blue color in the pdf to link texts,<br>
below error is still observed.</p>
<p>Error: Missing links</p>
<p>Did anyone else face same issue ?</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Also, no text in the pdf looks like a code block.<br>
But, Missing Code error was seen and after changing one of the paragraph by using markdown code syntax that error is gone.</li>
</ol>
<p>Appreciate any suggestions on the link error.</p>
