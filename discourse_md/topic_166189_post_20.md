# No Title

<p>I recently got mail and checked my marks for GA2 and noticed that the final score is showing as <strong>4.25</strong>, but while attempting the assignment earlier, I had scored <strong>7.25</strong> shown after submission.</p>
<p>Could you please help me understand how the marks were reduced? I want to ensure there was no error or misunderstanding in the evaluation.</p>
