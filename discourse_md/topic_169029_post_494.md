<p>MY Project 2 status is currently marked as Absent in the course dashboard. However, I would like to clarify that I submitted the repository and API endpoints well before the deadline through the designated forum.</p>
<p>Additionally, my Vercel server is still active, and the API is functioning correctly, as can be verified here:<br>
