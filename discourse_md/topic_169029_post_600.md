<p>Dear <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a></p>
<p>In the google form which we submitted I had pasted the API endpoint as the one which I got in the vercel dashboard i.e. <a href="https://tds-project2-rho.vercel.app/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://tds-project2-rho.vercel.app/</a><br>
whereas the correct api for giving post requests has <strong>/api</strong> added to the above which i forgot to add. i.e**.<a href="https://tds-project2-rho.vercel.app/api/**" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://tds-project2-rho.vercel.app/api/**</a><br>
I have checked again and the post requests are working.<br>
I know that I made a mistake in the form and regret the same. If possible, please evaluate my project 2 with  the above endpoint</p>
