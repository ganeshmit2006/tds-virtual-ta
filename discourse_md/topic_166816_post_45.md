<p>My week 1 score is showing absent in TDS from yesterday. Earlier it was showing 87.5 suddenly what happened I don’t understand its showing as absent… I have submitted my week 1 assignment before the deadline. Is it the same for every one or only for me… please some one clarify<br>

![Here are a few options for alt text, ranging in detail:

**Option 1 (Short & Sweet):**

```
IIT Madras online degree dashboard.
```

**Option 2 (More Descriptive):**

```
Screenshot of an IIT Madras online degree student dashboard, showing the current CGPA of 6.48 and a course titled "Tools in Data Science."
```

**Option 3 (Most Detailed):**

```
Mobile screenshot of an IIT Madras online degree dashboard.  It shows the date "18 February, 2025" and the term "January 2025". The page title is "My Current Courses", with a Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) of 6.48. A "Tools in Data Science" course is highlighted as "NEW COURSE" and assignment grades for week 1 (absent), week 2 (75.00), week 3 (100.00), and week 4 (90.00) are listed. A "Go to Course Page" button is visible. At the bottom is text about reporting harassment.
```

I would recommend using Option 2 or 3, depending on how much context you want to provide.  Option 3 is better if the specific details are important for understanding the content.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/e/2/e20cd24fd262c44005b6e6e5d825dbf1d610e071_2_224x500.jpeg)
