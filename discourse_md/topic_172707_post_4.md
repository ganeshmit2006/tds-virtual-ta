<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Which of the following is a valid log entry based on the provided format?</strong><br>
Due to a technical issue in the portal, both options 1 and 4 are correct answers. The final scoring has been adjusted accordingly, and full marks will be awarded for either response.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>HTTP method is idempotent</strong><br>
This question has been excluded from scoring as three methods (GET, PUT, and DELETE) are idempotent, with only POST being non-idempotent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Entries with 404 status code</strong><br>
Although the instructions did not explicitly state that filters applied for status code 404, we acknowledge this ambiguity. Full credit will be awarded for both option 1 and option 4.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Which of the following fields are necessary to filter “POST requests made for pages under /images/ from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays”?</strong><br>
Option A (Time, Request, Method, URL) is correct because:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Option B includes Size and Status, which aren’t needed for filtering by time, method, and URL</li>
<li>Option C includes Referer, which is unnecessary unless filtering by source page</li>
<li>Option D includes Status and Server, which aren’t relevant for this specific filtering requirement</li>
</ul>
