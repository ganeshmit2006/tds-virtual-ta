Evaluations will start before this weekend, with some sampling done possibly even tonight and most evaluation runs tomorrow.</p>
<p>Also we will prime the target first by sending a dummy request so it gets “warmed up” because some of you have reported time to respond to first request takes time for the server to spin up.<br>
Then once we know its responding, we will send requests for evaluation.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
