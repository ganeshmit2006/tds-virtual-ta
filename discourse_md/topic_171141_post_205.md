<p>I am still uncertain as to why I received a second email regarding my project 1 score, indicating a failure due to unmet pre-requisites. I have inquired multiple times, yet I have not received a response. Meanwhile, several other posts, both before and after mine, have been addressed. Kindly clarify about that mail.</p>
<p>Thankyou</p>
