<p>Hey <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a> , I actually submitted the project already in the morning,<br>
I included all the deliverables and things mentioned in the evaluation section.</p>
<p>But since I was actively testing with the - <code>datagen.py</code> and <code>evaluate.py</code>, I forgot to remove them before submission.</p>
<p>However these files do not play a role in my project execution in any way, they just sit idle. Will there be any issue?</p>
