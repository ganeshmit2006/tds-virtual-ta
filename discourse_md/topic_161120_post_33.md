<p>Hi Tushar,</p>
<p>For questions which require submitting a url, when you click on save button all those serverâ€™s should be running.</p>
<p>For that image uploading question one solution would be to keep image in a particular directory, and then upload from there every time you make a submission.</p>
<p>Kind regards<br>
