Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I am writing to you in a state of distress and humility. An unfortunate mistake on my part has led to the upload of an incorrect Docker image link. When I checked the authenticity of the link, it showed an error, even though the GitHub repository link is functioning perfectly.</p>
<p>I have poured my heart and soul into this project, dedicating countless hours and sleepless nights to ensure its success. The project has successfully passed both Test A and Test B, and I was thrilled to see my hard work paying off. However, this single error has left me devastated.</p>
<p>I am pleading with you, with all my heart, to allow me to correct this mistake by updating the Docker image link. Alternatively, I humbly request that my application be reviewed directly through GitHub. Please consider this an exception, as I have worked tirelessly over the past two weeks to create an application that is 890 lines long.</p>
<p>I beg for your understanding and leniency in this matter. This project means the world to me, and I am genuinely sobbing over this setback.</p>
<p>Thank you for considering my heartfelt request.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Rishit Jain<br>
