<p>I have a curious question.<br>
I have my project running from azure and code in GitHub repository.</p>
<p>What is stopping me from making further change to my deployment because my end point will be same. Anyway my code checksum for the deployment and GitHub code won’t match as I haven’t pushed the token to GitHub.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
