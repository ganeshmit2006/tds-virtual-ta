<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Yesterday I received the mail to start my server from 11 pm to 2 am, but I am very sorry that I did not read the mail on time and hence could not start the server on time. I request you kindly to give a second chance for re evaluation. I have done the project and it would not be fair if it is not evaluated.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
