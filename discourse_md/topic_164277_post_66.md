<p>Tasks in Phase A are defined but that does not mean it has to do one precise thing. If that was the case then there is no use for an LLM.</p>
<p>Your application should be able to take parse the input and be able to run commands that do similar things in parameterised fashion. It could be Wednesdays or Sundays or it might be in Arabic days or anything. So coding to precisely do something very specific is not the goal.</p>
<p>The program has to be intelligent to do a certain type or class of tasks.</p>
<p>We had a session introducing project. Week 3 session 1. But we will have a more hands on session on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
